#Data Structures
A look at data structures in C# (a work in progress)

This project is the result of working through the *Data Structures Succinctly Part 1* eBook by Robert Horvick from [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com).

[Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com) has 100+ eBooks covering a wide variety of technologies, available for free.  You do have to create an account to access them.

##Contents

####Singly Linked List

A linear collection of elements (nodes), with each element pointing to the next element in the collection.  The Singly Linked List can be traversed only in one direction.  From head to tail.

####Doubly Linked List

A linear collection of elements (nodes), with each element pointing to the next and previous elements in the collection.  The Doubly Linked List can be traversed in either forward or reverse direction.

####Array List

An Array List is similar to a Linked List but adds the ability to directly access elements by index.  As the name implies, the Array List is backed by an array.

####Stack
A collection that returns elements in the collection in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) pattern.

####Queue
A collection that returns elements in the collection in First In, First Out (FIFO) pattern.

####Deque
A Deque (pronounced "Deck") is a Double-Ended Queue.  Elements can be added and removed from both ends of the collection.

####BinaryTree
A BinaryTree implementation.

####Set
A Set is a collection implementing basic algebraic set algorithms such as union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference.
